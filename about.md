# Hi!

If you are here about software development, you have come to the right place. I needed a place to share my daily
battles with code and this is where it all went.

I am your typical software developer, nerd, geek (hence my nickname TOTOllyGeek), husband, father and metal fan.

I don't have a portfolio, since I am lazy, but you can read a bit about my professional career on [LinkedIn](https://bg.linkedin.com/in/totollygeek). I am mostly a Microsoft stack developer, but I am not a fanboy. I will develop everything I like, regardless of the vendor, infrastructure or operating system.

I have a [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/totollygeek/), which I am trying to update as often as I can, but you will notice this is not as often as I would like to. But if you subscribe, I might start putting up videos any moment now and become the next big thing in YouTube millionaires.

I am a social dude. You can follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/totollygeek), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/totollygeek/) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/totollygeek).

Mostly that's it. Stay tuned for more awesomeness!
