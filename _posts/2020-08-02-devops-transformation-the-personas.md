title: DevOps transformation - The personas in your journey

While I was doing our DevOps transformation journey, I have collaborated with a lot of my colleagues, and I have identified some personas who might be part of your journey as well. Having them identified and explained might help you out in your encounters.

Of course, this does not mean those people are good or bad. All of the people I've worked with always tried their best to do whatever they consider valuable for them and the company. It is just the nature of people to have a different attitude and therefore perceive the reality of DevOps in other contexts. Also, many times feelings get involved, which is always tricky, but people have feelings, and there is no escape :)

Here are some of the personas I have faced and how I tried working and discussing our journey with them.

## The "old-timer"

The "old-timer" is a person who typically has more than 15-20 years of experience in the field. He/she can be either a senior developer, tech or team lead. Since DevOps was not present in those years, when that persona got into software development, they are prone to be very conservative about such a significant turn of events.

### How to identify

* More than 15 years of experience
* Sceptical about DevOps and operational work in general
* Strong believer in specialization and doing things the correct way
* Perfectionists, always getting into the details
* Catchphrases:
  * "This will never work"
  * "I don't have the time to do everything"
  * "Most of the people are idiots"

### "Old timer" summary

This person is very valuable to you. Although they can be a pain very often, you can bounce ideas off them. Use them as a moral compass, in a way. They are very quality-oriented. The main reason for them to be skeptical is that such massive shifts in the way you work usually bring inevitable quality issues at the beginning. 

## The "full bananas"

## The "young hope"

## The "pragmatic"

## The "know it all"

## The others
