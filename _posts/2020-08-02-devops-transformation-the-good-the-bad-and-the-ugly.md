title: DevOps transformation - The good, the bad and the ugly

I have been part of the DevOps transformation group for our [customer](https://docuware.com) for the past 4 years. I have been working towards that goal in different positions and using different tools. What I have came to learn, is that this is no walk in the park. I've had my ups and downs. I will not lie - there were times, when I was begining to doubt if we are really supposed to do what we were doing, but always my doubts have been washed away by multiple wins we had along the route.

## The series

I plan to prepare a series of blog posts on that journey so far, which is far from over. Let me take you along and I hope some of the lessons I have learned, will help you shortcut some problems.

I am not yet sure how I will structure those, but you will be able to find the links to all the posts in the series here:
