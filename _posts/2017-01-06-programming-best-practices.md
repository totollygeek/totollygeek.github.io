In this series I will write some best practices that I have adopted and validated to be very useful, even critical sometimes, in my everyday's life as a C# developer.
The guidelines I am talking about don't necessarily apply only to **C#**, but this is the language I have most experience with.
I will start posting such an article every few days. And I will be more than happy to read your comments and suggestions about something I have missed or express your opinions against the ones I have put up here.
Of course I don't consider my suggestions to be a silver bullet in programming, but I am applying those standards strictly&nbsp;and I do believe they are valid and work.
Below you will find list of articles with links, which I will update when a new article is published.

- Best Practice #1: [Override the ToString() method of your classes]({% post_url 2017-01-18-best-practice-1-override-the-tostring-method-of-your-classes %})
- Best Practice #2: [Specify length of collections when you know it]({% post_url 2017-08-17-best-practice-2-specify-length-of-collections-when-you-know-it %})
