While I was doing our DevOps transformation journey, I have collaborated with a lot of my colleagues, and I have identified some personas who might be part of your journey as well. Having them identified and explained might help you out in your encounters.

Of course, this does not mean those people are good or bad. All of the people I've worked with, always tried their best to do whatever they consider valuable for them and the company. It is just the nature of people to have a different attitude and therefore perceive the reality of DevOps in other contexts. Also, many times feelings get involved, which is always tricky, but people have feelings, and there is no escape :)

Here are some of the personas I have faced and how I tried working and discussing our journey with them.

## The "old-timer"

The "old-timer" is a person who typically has more than 15-20 years of experience in the field. He/she can be either a senior developer, tech or team lead. Since DevOps was not present in those years, when that persona got into software development, they are prone to be very conservative about such a significant turn of events.

### How to identify

* More than 15 years of experience
* Skeptical about DevOps and operational work in general
* Strong believer in specialization and doing things the correct way
* Perfectionists, always getting into the details
* Catchphrases:
  * "This will never work"
  * "I don't have the time to do everything"
  * "Most of the people are idiots"

### "Old timer" summary

This person is very valuable to you. Although they can be a pain very often, you can bounce ideas off them. Use them as a moral compass, in a way. They are very quality-oriented. The main reason for them to be skeptical is that such massive shifts in the way you work usually bring inevitable quality issues at the beginning. Also, they tend to think that practices which they don't see how would work in a specific context, do not work anywhere. You need to constantly try to prove them why DevOps works, because if you win them over, that would be a HUGE success.

## The "full bananas"

This is DevOps-coholic. This is the person, who wants to take everything to extremes. Thousands microservices, hundreds of releases per day, completely decoupled architecture. Usually they are a strong ally in the transformation, since they would evangelize about all of those things constantly. A complete opposite of the [Old Timer](#the-old-timer). Extremes, on the other hand, are not a good thing.

### Hot to identify

* Very proactive. So much, that it can be annoying sometimes
* Usually a goto person for advice on pipelines, repositories, deployments, etc.
* People centric persona
* Usually a positive, optimistic person
* Catchphrases:
  * "That is not so hard. You can do everything"
  * "Technical debt is the silent killer"
  * "DevOps will set us free"

### "Full bananas" summary

Generally those are the people who will lead your transformation. They will do everything in their power to make it happen. The main goal they are trying to achieve is that every team is successful in doing the ideal state of DevOps described in the [books]({% post_url 2021-01-13-devops-the-books-you-should-read %}). Give those people freedom, but monitor them, since they tend to spiral deep into the rabbit hole.

## The "young hope"

Those are the fresh young people. The juniors and recently became seniors. Those are usually people who have gathered their knowledge for software development in the age of DevOps and all of those things have been there for them. They are enthusiastic and what to do new stuff. They want to be part of the "cool kids" who do Docker, Kubernetes, Automation, etc.

### Hot to identify

* Young people with desire to learn
* Operation tasks and researches are usually assigned to them
* Proactive in about 50% of the cases
* Legacy code scares them
* Catchphrases:
  * "I can do that, I'll just Google it for a bit"
  * "I want to do new and exciting stuff"
  * "Maybe this can be automated"

### "Young hope" summary

When you want to make transformation in a team, usually it is very hard to turn the whole team into DevOps mindset simultaneously. It is not only hard, but it is the wrong thing to do. Usually you will be the person outside the team, that will try to tell them how to work and most of the seniors and especially "old timers" will block that attempt. The way you do it is by using the "young hope". You should get them hooked up first, which in most cases is already done. Then have them transform the team from the inside by example and by evangelizing internally.

## The "pragmatic"

## The "know it all"

## The others
